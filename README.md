Our First Repo

Hey everyone! This is just a repo that I'm setting up to learn how to use GitHub! I'm getting more and more
  experience in programming and need to start building a portfolio. I own Mad Bomber Labs, and we specialize in creating
  custom software be it mobile apps, websites, or computer programs! In the local area we do a plethora of other things
  to include device repair, PC builds, and YouTube!
 
Check us out at http://madbomberlabs.com! The site is currently undergoing a redesign and hopefully by the time of reading this will
  have links to all our social media and much more information than this!
  
Thanks for stopping by! And please, pitch in your comments and advice!
